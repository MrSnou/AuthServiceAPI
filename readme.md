# Project goal: practical mastery of Spring Boot Security, JWT, and REST API architecture.

# üîê Auth Service API

The Auth Service API is a backend application based on **Spring Boot**, used to **authenticate and authorize users** using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
The project was created to teach and practically apply key Spring security mechanisms.

Project frozen - Due to the realization that I am writing a second identical application only in Spring Boot, I am moving to another project to learn more Spring Boot features.
