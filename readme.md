# Project goal: practical mastery of Spring Boot Security, JWT, and REST API architecture.

# 🔐 Auth Service API

The Auth Service API is a backend application based on **Spring Boot**, used to **authenticate and authorize users** using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
The project was created to teach and practically apply key Spring security mechanisms.

## 🚀 Features

- New user registration (`/api/auth/register`)
- Login with JWT generation (`/api/auth/login`)
- Token refresh (`/api/auth/refresh`)
- Logout (deleting the JWT cookie) (`/api/auth/logout`)
- User profile (user details) (`/api/auth/me`)
- Token validation via `JwtAuthenticationFilter`
- Token support in both the **Authorization* header and cookies (`HttpOnly cookie`)
- Secure endpoints only for logged-in users

Project frozen - Due to the realization that I am writing a second identical application only in Spring Boot, I am moving to another project to learn more Spring Boot features.
